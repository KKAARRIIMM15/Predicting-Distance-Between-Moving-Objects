# Calculating-Distance-Between-Moving-Objects
This project shows custom-built weighted graph to track objects in a video and visualize their movement paths .The goal is to enhance object tracking by representing movement as a graph structure, where nodes represent object positions,  and edges are weighted by the Euclidean distance between consecutive detections.
